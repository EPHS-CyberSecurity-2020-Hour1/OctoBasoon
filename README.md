> Public key encryption is going to break soon

> Quantum computers will be able to determine private keys from the public keys

> And thus the Internet as we know it may cease to be secure; cryptograms will be functionally plaintext

> Alternatively, a new kind of cipher will be needed

> One where decryption is unrealistic

> The cipher text will have to correspond to qubits!

> How far we've come from a caesar cipher!
