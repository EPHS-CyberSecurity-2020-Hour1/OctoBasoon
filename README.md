> Public key encryption is going to break soon

> Quantum computers will be able to determine private keys from the public keys

> And thus the Internet as we know it may cease to be secure; cryptograms will be functionally plaintext

> Alternatively, a new kind of cipher will be needed

> One where decryption is unrealistic

> The cipher text will have to correspond to qubits!

> How far we've come from a caesar cipher!

> Definitions:

> Public key: a publicly available method to decrypt information

> Private key: a private method to encrypt information

> Cryptogram: encrypted information

> Cipher: a list of what encrypts/decrypts to what or a method to get what information encrypts/decrypts to

> Decryption: turning encrypted information into usable information

> Cipher text: text to be encrypted

> Caesar cipher: a method of encryption where each letter corresponds to another
